# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN in PyTorch

-   The CNN used is a simplified version of a ResNet implemented based on the [Myrtle.ai blog](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet-4-architecture/)
-   The hyperparameters batch size, learning rate, and weight decay are tuned using Optuna
-   The model achieves a test accuracy of 90.99% after 40 epochs of training
